# cli_python_template
My basic template for CLI scripts in Python. It creates a logger that logs to both stderr and a file in the current directory and parses CLI parameters.

## Installation

$ pip install -e DIRECTORY

like so

$ pip install cli_python_template

## Uninstall

Uninstall for "editable" scripts must use the package name, like so

$ pip uninstall script

The name is defined in setup.py.
